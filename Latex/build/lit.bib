abstract = "The table is a compilation of experimental measurements of static magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments of ground states and excited states of atomic nuclei throughout the periodic table. To aid identification of the states, their excitation energy, half-life, spin, and parity are given, along with a brief indication of the method and any reference standard used in the particular measurement. The literature search covers the period to late 2004. Many of the entries prior to 1988 follow those in Raghavan [At. Data Nucl. Data Tables 42 (1989) 189]."
